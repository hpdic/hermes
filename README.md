# Hermes: MySQL Plugin for Homomorphic Encryption

The name **Hermes** stands for **Homomorphic Encryption for Relational MySQL Engine Support**. The system integrates encrypted computation directly into SQL workflows via native MySQL UDF plugins. The name is also inspired by Hermes‚Äîthe Greek god of communication and messenger of the gods‚Äîsymbolizing secure, efficient delivery of information across domains.

## üîç Key Features

- `HERMES_ENC_SINGULAR_BFV`: Encrypts a plaintext integer into a base64-encoded BFV ciphertext.
- `HERMES_DEC_SINGULAR_BFV`: Decrypts a base64 ciphertext and returns the original integer.
- `HERMES_SUM_BFV`: Aggregates encrypted values homomorphically across rows (compatible with `GROUP BY`).
- `HERMES_MUL_BFV`: Homomorphic ciphertext √ó ciphertext multiplication.
- `HERMES_MUL_SCALAR_BFV`: Homomorphic scalar multiplication (ciphertext √ó plaintext integer).

## üöÄ Quick Start

To build and run tests:

```bash
./script/build.sh
./script/test.sh
```

For detailed setup and requirements, see [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md).

## üß™ Demo Workflow

The script `script/test.sh` performs:

1. Sample data creation in MySQL.
2. Homomorphic encryption of salary values using BFV.
3. Decryption verification using SQL.
4. Grouped summation using `HERMES_SUM_BFV`.
5. Multiplication of encrypted salaries by plaintext scalars (e.g., bonuses).
6. Full ciphertext √ó ciphertext multiplication (e.g., salary √ó months).
